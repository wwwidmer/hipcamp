Using JavaScript (React preferred), CSS (Sass preferred) and the initial
template file campground.html, please reveal the top level camp features
as a <ul> list, based on the sample JSON structure defined in camp_features.js
(letâ€™s assume this JSON structure is what an API could return).

Indicate whether or not each feature is present at the campground.
Clicking on a feature should reveal its sub-features, if they're present or
not, and so on.

The presence or absence of each feature may be indicated with an icon, a
different color, or both. Feel free to make it look great!

Each <li> element should be a bubble that's clickable in case there are
sub-features to reveal. Sub-features should be displayed in a nested <ul> list.

Adding or removing features from camp_features.js should automatically update the
DOM when the page is reloaded.

Clear, concise, "production-ready" code will be appreciated.
